            Kakum National Park, located in the coastal environs of the Central Region of Ghana,
             covers an area of 375 square kilometres (145 sq mi). <br>Established in 1931 as a reserve, 
             it was gazetted as a national park only in 1992<br> after an initial survey of avifauna was
              conducted. The area is covered with tropical forest.
